## Reflection

This was high school's Computer Science graduation project, written in 2007-2008 in Delphi and Pascal. Project goals included using Object Oriented Programming and principles of Software design with Computer Graphis. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was combining everything I've learnt during 3 years of high school to a first end to end project. Builing and testing the entire game took around 6 months of weekly work, while learning Delphi at the same time.

My inspiration for the game came after watching and getting thrilled by several Red Bull Flugtag contests.
